## Description 📝

This repo contains the job done so far for the [OCRE](http://numismatics.org/ocre/) coin classification project.

The project consists on ... (coin classification, should add something interesting here...)

## Requirements 💻

### Execution
* [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/)
* [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/)
* [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/) (recommended)

### Scraping
* [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)
* [wget](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wget)


## Development phases ⚙️

The phases of the development consist on:

1. Scraping [OCRE](http://numismatics.org/ocre/) to create a training dataset:
	* Scraping and dropping off data without images (since we want to train a NN using image features)

2. Preprocessing:
	* Downloading images from DB (obtained dataset)
	* Feature extraction (which includes the image processing for each coin)

3. Pre-classifier:
	* Heads or tails
	* Period
	* Specs

4. Build NN
5. Train classifier and predict
